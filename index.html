	<h3>About myself</h3>
	<p>I have been working in the restaurant business for more than 10 years. 
		Thanks to my perseverance and desire, I was promoted to director and there
		 were three objects in the management. </p>
	<p>Now I want to change my field of activity, and I have no doubt that my
		 skills and the ability to think outside the box will be a good addition 
		 to my work. The old love of mathematics and complex logic problems helped 
		 in solving being a programmer. </p>
	<p>I studied at school 42, studied for a year and wrote projects in C and C++. 
		However, the direction of the backend is not as much interested as 
		the opportunity to develop in the frontend. I like the combination 
		of precision of lines, as in architecture, and the search for aesthetics
		 in design, as in drawing. </p>
	<p>I have no experience in commercial IT projects. But I'm sure he'll be here soon. </p>
	<h3>Education</h3>
		<p>2020-2021</p>
		<p>Programmer</p>
		<p>School 42 (Moscow campus)</p>
		<p>2008-2013</p>
		<p>Financial Manager</p>
		<p>Moscow State Industrial University</p>
	<h3>Courses</h3>
		<p>Interactive simulator SQL on Stepik</p>
		<p>The Basics HTLM and CSS on Stepik</p>
	<h3>Review code on C</h3>
	<p>Re-code the set of the lib function. 
		Functions will need to present the same prototype and behaviors as the original.</p>
		char	*ft_substr(char const *s, unsigned int start, size_t len)
		{
			size_t		i;
			char		*newstr;
			size_t		slen;
		
			if (!s)
				return (NULL);
			if (start > ft_strlen(s))
				return (ft_strdup(""));
			slen = ft_strlen(s + start);
			if (slen < len)
				len = slen;
			newstr = malloc(len + 1);
			if (!newstr)
				return (NULL);
			i = 0;
			while (s[start + i] && i < len)
			{
				newstr[i] = s[start + i];
				i++;
			}
			newstr[i] = '\0';
			return (newstr);
		}

		<h3>Review code on C++</h3>
		<p>There are two boxes, the first one is A1×B1×C1, the second one is A2×B2×C2. 
		Determine whether it is possible to place one of these boxes inside the other, 
		provided that the boxes can only be rotated 90 degrees around the edges.</p>
